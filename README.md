# REST API using JWT and SQLite

## How the API works

This project contains a simple REST API using the CRUD pattern, secured by JWT(JSON Web Token), running under Node.js.</br>
The data of this webservice is stored in a SQLite Database.</br>
I decided to comment the source files rather then describe the methods in the readme.

## Steps to get things work

To use the app, you need to execute following steps:
1. Install Node.js
2. Go to the project's main directory.
3. Generate public.key and private.key via [Online RSA Key Generator](https://travistidwell.com/jsencrypt/demo/)
4. Type `npm install` - Wait for Completion
5. Type `nodemon server` - To start the REST API server
6. Type `npm start` - To start the demo (client)
